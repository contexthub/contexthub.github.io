# Element Services

## Elements

Element services provide the ability to interact with basic elements in ContextHub (beacons and geofences) as well as subscribing to tags which generate events whenever elements are created, updated or deleted.

###Beacons
**[Beacons](/docs/android/element-services/beacons)** are Bluetooth Low Energy micro-location devices compatible with Android v4.4 KitKat (or newer) and are handled by `ProximityService` and `BeaconProxy`. Integrating beacons into your application allows you to build new location experiences inside areas much smaller and out of reach compared to traditional location technologies like GPS, WiFi and cellular triangulation.

###Geofences
**[Geofences](/docs/android/element-services/geofences)** are predefined areas of interest marked by a center and radius and are handled by `LocationService` and `GeofenceProxy`. Geofences let your application be aware of users entering or exiting an area of interest so you can respond to these events in a more dynamic and unique way.

###Subscriptions
**[Subscriptions](/docs/android/element-services/subscriptions)** are the element notification system in ContextHub that is handled by `SubscriptionProxy`. The service deals with background notifications whenever beacons, geofences, and vault items are created, updated or deleted. This lets your application be more responsive to events generated by other devices or context rules, enabling you to create a truly modern and responsive experience for your users.
